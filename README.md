### Introduction

---

In this work, we use network architecture search(NAS) with self-supervised learning to find a hybrid&suitable architecture on a given dataset adaptively in sequential recommendation. The framework is illustrated as follows:

![model](model.png)

### Requirements

---
 - pytorch 1.x
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - tqdm

### Usage

---

```python
python main.py --data_path your_path --max_len seq_len
```

For more detailed params, please refer to args.py

### Results

---

We performed our NASR on two datasets of Movielens and LastFM, and the result tested on Movielens is shown as follows:

>for fair comparison, all the models are trained in auto-regressive manner
